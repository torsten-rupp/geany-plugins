About
-----

The builder plugin for Geany provides an alternative way to build
a project. The plugin offer a set of toolbar buttons and a toolbar
menu to build, clean, run and stop a build process resp. the built
application. Make and compiler output messages are parsed via
definable regular expressions and shown in a list with errors and
warnings.

Features
--------

* toolbar build buttons
* toolbar build menu
* definable regular expressions for detecting errors and warnings
* separated lists with errors and warnings from a build
* automatic save and show first error/warning
* keybindings
* project and global configurations
* configuration dialogs

Usage
-----

Enable plugin:

Enable the plugin in the menu Tools->Plugin Manager

Configuration:

There are two sections for configuration: global configuration which
is used for all projects and a project specific configuration. The
global configuration can be found either in the plugin preferences or
via the toolbar button menu. The global configuration consists of:

* definable commands to build, clena, make all, make custom target,
  make object and run the application including an optional working
  directory. The working directory may contain the following
  placeholders:
    %d current document directory
    %e current document base name
    %f current document file name
    %p project base directory
    %l current line number
    %t custom target text

* list of regular expressions to detect errors, warnings and
  error/warnings extension messages. The regular expression may use
  the following group names:
    <filePath>     file path
    <lineNumber>   line number
    <columnNumber> column number
    <message>      message

  A regular expression have one of the following types assigned:
    enter     identify when entering a sub-directory during the build
    leave     identify when leaving a sub-directory during the build
    error     identify an error during the build
    warning   identify an warning during the build
    extension identify an extension line for the last erorr or warning

  The sample line in the edit regular expression dialog can be used to
  past a sample output line to test if the entered regular expression
  matches this line in the expected way. Note: the sample line and the
  shown regular expression group results are not stored.

  Matching lines of the build output are listed in the errors resp.
  warnings tab and can be located in the corresponding document.

* visible toolbar buttons to build, clean, run or stop

* indicators and colors of indicators

* checkboxes for auto save, add project regular expressions and show
  first error or warning

The project specific configuration consist of:

* definable commands to build, clena, make all, make custom target,
  make object and run the application including an optional working
  directory. The working directory may contain the following
  placeholders:
    %d current document directory
    %e current document base name
    %f current document file name
    %p project base directory
    %l current line number
    %t custom target text

* additional error and warning regular expression

Available key bindings:

  Build
  Clean
  Make all
  Make custom target
  Make object
  Show previous error
  Show next error
  Show previous warning
  Show next warning
  Run
  Stop
  Project properties
  Plugin configuration

Build:

To build a project either press the "Build" button in the toolbar or
select some specific build action from the menu. The toolbar button
"Clean" usually do a clean action as defined in the command settings
above. "Run" start the application, "Stop" terminate a running build
action or stop the application.

Locate errors and warnings:

Detected errors and warnings and the raw build output are shown in
the "Builder" tab. Detected errors and warnings can be located by
clicking on the entries or via the defined short-cut keys.

To edit or add a new error or warning detection regular expression
entry a right-click on the corresponding line will open a context
menu to edit or add a regular expression. For convenience the line
is copied to the sample field in the regular expression dialog.

Requirements
------------

* GTK >= 2.8.0
* geany >= 1.37
